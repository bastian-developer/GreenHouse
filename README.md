# GreenHouse Project

This system uses multiple sensors to monitor air humidity, soil moisture, light intensity, and temperature, with data processed by an Arduino microcontroller and transmitted via WiFi to an Android app. Users can view crop information, receive environmental alerts, and adjust settings to control lights, irrigation, and ventilation through the app. A PHP-based web server supports data collection and user management. The primary goal is to improve crop production, automate cultivation tasks, and reduce costs by minimizing unnecessary resource use.
